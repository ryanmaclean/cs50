#Files used for Harvard's CS50 Course
I'll be updating these as I go through the online CS50 course via EDx
on my Mac instead of using the virtual machine supplied as it's quite 
large and cumbersome.

#Git 
I'll be using this to get used to Git on the command line as I'm 
typically using SourceTree as a cructh (and what a great crutch it is!)

Pushing the code:
'git push origin master'

#Brew
I'm also using the amazing Homebrew (http://brew.sh) in order to 
manage packages for the course. 

For example, the first package I installed was git:
'brew install git'

#Vi
I'm similarly taking this opportunity to re-learn Vi, as opposed to
Nano, Vim or Emacs (or perhaps Gedit, Sublime, Eclipse).

As I find tips and tricks, I'll be adding them here. 

For example, using "d" to remove lines of text, or "c" to remove a line
and switch to insert mode. 

I've also found using "a" instead of "i" is handy to add text *after* the 
cursor, instead of before it. 

All of this is pretty rudimentary stuff, but as I took CS over 15 years 
ago, it's handy to revisit the basics!
